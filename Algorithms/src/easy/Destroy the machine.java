/*
âœ… Problem Explanation :
Jack has a machine that runs in a certain pattern:

It first starts at time T seconds.

Then every D seconds, it runs twice:

First at time T + D

Then again at time T + D + 1

This pattern continues for every next D seconds:

So machine runs at times:
T, T+D, T+D+1, T+2D, T+2D+1, T+3D, T+3D+1, ...

Now Jack wants to destroy the machine at time x.
He can only destroy it if the machine is not running at time x.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Print "YES" if the machine is running at time x,
Print "NO" if the machine is not running at time x.
